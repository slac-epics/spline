##Overview
Module supports cubic splining of data. It uses alglib libraries 
embedded in EPICS aSubRoutine to accomplish the spline. 

spline.template contains epics database template to implement a spline and 
inverse of spline

A direct transofrmation transforms X into Y and the $(DIR) macro must be set to 0
An inverse transformation transforms Y to X and the $(DIR) macro must be set to 1
To create an inverse INPC of the TRANS record must be set to 1.

Multiple transformation can be created. 

##Application Use
To add cubic spline support to your application modify the following:
   -configure/RELEASE
        SPLINE=<path to module version>

   -<yourApp>/src/Makefile add the following lines.
        <yourApp>_DBD += spline.dbd
        <yourApp>_LIBS += spline
   
   -<yourApp>/Db/Makefile add the following lines.
        DB_INSTALLS += $(SPLINE)/db/spline.template

These modifications will include all the nessecary support

Use spline.template to construct your database
    The $TNAME macro indentifies which spline the record uses
    
    The spline is built from a csv file of measured data points
    in the st.cmd you specify the file and assign it a transformation
    name. 

    
    splineInit(<transformation name >,<filepath>)

     There can be multiple splines if nessecary.

##Errors
If alglib error is encoutered it will stop the IOC and output alglib::ap_error 
this means the data file is either corrupt or the measurement points cannot be 
splined.
