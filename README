Application supports cubic splining of data. It uses alglib libraries 
embedded in EPICS aSubRoutine to accomplish the spline. 

spline.template contains epics database template to implement a spline and 
inverse of spline
There are 4 main records.
      TRANS : holds subroutines and does calculation
      FNAME : holds name of file that contains real data points 
      IN    : input value
      OUT   : output value

To create an inverse INPC of the TRANS record must be set to 1.

Multiple transformation can be created. 
Database files must be formatted as a csv non-utf8. It is expected
all data is non-zero. Subroutine will look for data file inside $IOC_DATA/$IOC/measurements/ or in the current directory.
